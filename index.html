      <p>Arturo "Artie" Bradic was born in Mexico City in 1995 and immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 5. 
        He grew up in Northwest Arkansas and eventually moved to Tucson, AZ to pursue a Neuroscience and
        Cognitive Science degree at the University of Arizona.</p>

      <p>While in school, he was involved in multiple research labs including the Gothard Lab
        which aimed to understand the neural basis of emotion by recording the electrophysiological activity
        of the amygdala in rhesus macaques. In his freetime, he enjoyed drawing, video editing, and photoshop.
      </p>

      <p>After graduating and working in medicine
        for 2 years, he realized pursuing medical school was not the right path for him and switched
        careers to another interest that fullfilled his need for creativity and creation: technology
            and development. Na√Øve or ambitious? We'll find out soon...</p>
